# TricTracTroe
A Machine Learning based tic tac toe game developed in c++

It uses An Array to store all the possible positions that can arise in a game of Tic Tac Toe and then  on playing against 
a human player it observes the  moves that lead to victory or draw result and assigns each position in the array with the best next move.

# To play

use number keys to select the position and press enter to move.Currently game is in Two player Mode only.
position are like this :

                   1 | 2 | 3
                ..............
                   4 | 5 | 6
                ..............
                   7 | 8 | 9     Numbers of the Grid Structre of Tic Tac Toe
for the tic tac toe grid. Chose number accordingly.
#Notes
I  further also plan to take the human out of the system and make the game train itslef by playing games against itself making it unsupervised learning system.
Just like Arthur Samuel's Checkers.
Also Incase this thing becomes too smart please don't use it to make AI weapons :P  .
