# TricTracTroe
A Machine Learning based tic tac toe game developed in c++

It uses An Array to store all the possible positions that can arise in a game of Tic Tac Toe and then  on playing against 
a human player it observes the  moves that lead to victory or draw result and assigns each position in the array with the best next move.

I  further also plan to take the human out of the system and make the game train itslef by playing games against itself making it unsupervised learning system.
Just like Arthur Samuel's Checkers.
Also Incase this thing becomes too smart please don't use it to make AI weapons :P  .
